Companies in the semiconductor ecosystem make chips (the triangle on the left) and sell them to companies and government agencies (on the right). Those companies and government agencies then design the chips into systems and devices (e.g. iPhones, PCs, airplanes, cloud computing, etc.), and sell them to consumers, businesses, and governments. The revenue of products that contain chips is worth tens of\u00a0trillions of dollars.\n![[The Semiconductor Ecosystem.png]]\nYet, given how large it is, the industry remains a mystery to most.\u00a0 If you do think of the semiconductor industry at all, you may picture workers in bunny suits in a fab clean room (the chip factory) holding a 12\u201d wafer. Yet it is a business that manipulates materials an atom at a time and its factories cost 10s of billions of dollars to build.\u00a0 (By the way, that wafer has two\u00a0_trillion_\u00a0transistors on it.)\n![[clean-room-holding-a-wafer.png]]\nIf you were able to look inside the simple triangle representing the semiconductor industry, instead of a single company making chips, you would find an industry with hundreds of companies, all dependent on each other. Taken as a whole it\u2019s pretty overwhelming, so let\u2019s describe one part of the ecosystem at a time.\u00a0 (Warning \u2013\u00a0 this is a\u00a0_simplified_\u00a0view of a very complex industry.)\n## **Semiconductor Industry Segments**\nThe semiconductor industry has seven different types of companies. Each of these distinct industry segments feeds its resources up the value chain to the next until finally a chip factory (a \u201cFab\u201d) has all the designs, equipment, and materials necessary to manufacture a chip. Taken from the bottom up these semiconductor industry segments are:\n1. Chip Intellectual Property (IP) \n2. Electronic Design Automation (EDA)\n3. Specialized Materials\u00a0\n4. Wafer Fab Equipment (WFE)\n5. \u201cFabless\u201d Chip Companies\u00a0\n6. Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs)\n7. Chip Foundries\n8. Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT)\n![[semi-eco-plus-OSAT.png]]\nThe following sections below provide more detail about each of these eight semiconductor industry segments.\n### **Chip Intellectual Property (IP) Cores**\n- The\u00a0_design_\u00a0of a chip may be owned by a single company, or\u2026\n- Some companies license their chip designs \u2013 as software building blocks, called IP Cores \u2013 for wide use\n- There are over 150 companies that sell chip IP Cores\n- For example, Apple licenses IP Cores from\u00a0[ARM](https://www.arm.com/)\u00a0as a building block of their microprocessors in their iPhones and Computers\n![[Chip-IP-cores.png]]\n### **Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Tools**\n- Engineers design chips (adding their own designs on top of any IP cores they\u2019ve bought) using specialized Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software\n- The industry is dominated by three U.S. vendors\u2013[Cadence](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home.html),\u00a0[Mentor](https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/)\u00a0(now part of Siemens) and\u00a0[Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/)\n- It takes a large engineering team using these EDA tools 2-3 years to design a complex logic chip like a microprocessor used inside a phone, computer or server.

But to turn it into something tangible we\u2019re going to have to physically produce it in a chip factory called a \u201cfab.\u201d The factories that make chips need to buy specialized materials and chemicals:\n\n- Silicon wafers \u2013 and to make those they need crystal growing furnaces\n- [Over 100 Gases](https://www.linde-gas.com/en/images/Gasworld%20-%20Creating%20a%20Semiconductor%20FEB18_tcm17-477345.pdf)\u00a0are used \u2013 bulk gases (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, argon, helium), and other exotic/toxic gases (fluorine, nitrogen trifluoride, arsine, phosphine, boron trifluoride, diborane, silane, and the list goes on\u2026)\n- Fluids ([photoresists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresist), top coats,\u00a0[CMP slurries](https://www.surfaceconditioning.saint-gobain.com/news/choosing-best-cmp-slurry))\n- [Photomasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomask)\n- Wafer handling equipment, dicing\n- [RF Generators](https://www.microwavejournal.com/articles/21140-rf-technology-in-semiconductor-wafer-processing)\n![[materials-small.png]]\n### **Wafer Fab Equipment (WFE) Make the Chips**\n- These machines physically manufacture the chips\n- Five companies dominate the industry\u2013\u00a0[Applied Materials](https://www.appliedmaterials.com/),\u00a0[KLA](https://www.kla.com/),\u00a0[LAM](https://www.lamresearch.com/),\u00a0[Tokyo Electron](https://www.tel.com/)\u00a0and\u00a0[ASML](https://www.asml.com/en)\n- These are some of the most complicated (and expensive) machines on Earth. They take a slice of an ingot of silicon and manipulate its atoms on and below its surface\n- We\u2019ll explain how these machines are used a bit later on\n![[Wafer-Fab-Equipment.png]]\n### \u00a0**\u201cFabless\u201d Chip Companies**\n- Systems companies (Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) that previously used off-the-shelf chips now design their own chips.\n- They create chip designs (using IP Cores and their own designs) and send the designs to \u201cfoundries\u201d that have \u201cfabs\u201d that manufacture them\n- They may use the chips exclusively in their own devices e.g. Apple, Google, Amazon \u2026.\n- Or they may sell the chips to everyone e.g. AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom\u2026\n- They do not own Wafer Fab Equipment or use specialized materials or chemicals\n- They do use Chip IP and Electronic Design Software to design the chips\n![[fabless.png]]\n### **Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs)**\n- Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) design, manufacture (in their own fabs), and sell\u00a0_their own_\u00a0chips\n    - They do not make chips for other companies (this is changing rapidly \u2013 see\u00a0[here](https://stratechery.com/2022/the-intel-split/).)\n    - There are three categories of IDMs\u2013 Memory (e.g.\u00a0[Micron](https://www.micron.com/),\u00a0[SK Hynix](https://product.skhynix.com/home.go)), Logic (e.g.\u00a0[Intel](http://www.intel.com/)), Analog ([TI](https://www.ti.com/),\u00a0[Analog Devices](https://www.analog.com/en/index.html))\n- They have their own \u201cfabs\u201d but may also use foundries\n    - They use Chip IP and Electronic Design Software to design their chips\n    - They buy Wafer Fab Equipment and use specialized materials and chemicals\n- The average cost of taping out a new leading-edge chip (3nm) is now $500 million\n![[IDMs.png]]\n### \u00a0**Chip Foundries**\n- Foundries make chips for others in their \u201cfabs\u201d\n- They buy and integrate equipment from a variety of manufacturers\n    - Wafer Fab Equipment and specialized materials and chemicals\n- They design unique processes using this equipment to\u00a0_make_\u00a0the chips\n- But they\u00a0_don\u2019t design chips_\n- [TSMC](https://www.tsmc.com/english)\u00a0in Taiwan is the leader in logic,\u00a0[Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/)\u00a0is second\n- Other fabs specialize in making chips for analog, power, rf, displays, secure military, etc.\n- It costs $20 billon to build a new generation chip (3nm) fabrication plant\n![[foundries.png]]\n#### **Fabs**\n- Fabs are short for fabrication plants \u2013 the factory that makes chips\n- Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs)\u00a0_and_\u00a0Foundries both have fabs. The only difference is whether they make chips for others to use or sell or make them for themselves to sell.\n- Think of a Fab as analogous to a book printing plant (see figure below)\n1. Just as an author writes a book using a word processor, an engineer designs a chip using electronic design automation tools\n2. An author contracts with a publisher who specializes in their genre and then sends the text to a printing plant. An engineer selects a fab appropriate for their type of chip (memory, logic, RF, analog)\n3. The printing plant buys paper and ink. A fab buys raw materials; silicon, chemicals, gases\n4. The printing plant buys printing machinery, presses, binders, trimmers. The fab buys wafer fab equipment, etchers, deposition, lithography, testers, packaging\n5. The printing process for a book uses offset lithography, filming, stripping, blueprints, plate making, binding and trimming. Chips are manufactured in a complicated process manipulating atoms using etchers, deposition, lithography. Think of it as an atomic level offset printing. The wafers are then cut up and the chips are packaged\n6. The plant turns out millions of copies of the same book. The plant turns out millions of copies of the same chip\n![[printing.png]]\nWhile this sounds simple, it\u2019s not. Chips are probably the most complicated products ever manufactured.\u00a0 The diagram below is a simplified version of the\u00a0_1000+_\u00a0steps it takes to make a chip.\n![[Chip-fab-steps.png]]\n### Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT)\n- Companies that package and test chips made by foundries and IDMs\n- OSAT companies take the wafer made by foundries, dice (cut) them up into individual chips, test them and then package them and ship them to the customer\n![[OSAT.png]]\n## **Fab Issues**\n- As chips have become denser (with trillions of transistors on a single wafer) the cost of building fabs have skyrocketed \u2013 now >$10 billion for one chip factory\n- One reason is that the cost of the equipment needed to make the chips has skyrocketed\n    - Just one advanced lithography machine from\u00a0[ASML](https://www.asml.com/en), a Dutch company, costs $150 million\n    - There are ~500+ machines in a fab (not all as expensive as ASML)\n    - The fab building is incredibly complex. The clean room where the chips are made is just the tip of the iceberg of a complex set of plumbing feeding gases, power, liquids all at the right time and temperature into the wafer fab equipment\n- The multi-billion-dollar cost of staying at the leading edge has meant most companies have dropped out. In 2001 there were 17 companies making the most advanced chips.\u00a0 Today there are only two \u2013\u00a0[Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/)\u00a0in Korea and\u00a0[TSMC](https://www.tsmc.com/english)\u00a0in Taiwan.\n    - Given that China believes Taiwan is a province of China this could be problematic for the West.\n![[companies-at-leading-edge.png]]\n## **What\u2019s Next \u2013 Technology**\nIt\u2019s getting much harder to build chips that are denser, faster, and use less power, so what\u2019s next?\n- Instead of making a single processor do all the work, logic chip designers have put multiple specialized processors inside of a chip\n- Memory chips are now made denser by stacking them 100+ layers high\n- As chips are getting more complex to design, which means larger design teams, and longer time to market, Electronic Design Automation companies are embedding artificial intelligence to automate parts of the design process\n- Wafer equipment manufacturers are designing new equipment to help fabs make chips with lower power, better\u00a0[performance, optimum area-to-cost, and faster time to market](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10iOkW6LfURNLND8z61eXbDx_Y-8jkBRr/view?usp=sharing)\n## **What\u2019s Next \u2013 Business**\nThe business model of Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) like\u00a0[Intel](http://www.intel.com/)\u00a0is rapidly changing. In the past there was a huge competitive advantage in being vertically integrated i.e. having your own design tools and fabs. Today, it\u2019s a disadvantage.\n\n- Foundries have economies of scale and standardization. Rather than having to invent it all themselves, they can utilize the entire stack of innovation in the ecosystem. And just focus on manufacturing\n- [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en)\u00a0has proven that it\u2019s possible to shift from an IDM to a fabless foundry model.\u00a0[Intel](http://www.intel.com/)\u00a0is trying. They are going to use\u00a0[TSMC](https://www.tsmc.com/english)\u00a0as a foundry for their own chips as well as set up their own foundry\n## **What\u2019s Next \u2013 Geopolitics**\nControlling advanced chip manufacturing in the 21st century may well prove to be like controlling the oil supply in the 20th. The country that controls this manufacturing can throttle the military and economic power of others.\n- Ensuring a steady supply of chips has become a national priority. (China\u2019s largest import by $\u2019s are semiconductors \u2013 larger than oil)\n- Today, both the U.S. and\u00a0[China](https://www.semiconductors.org/chinas-share-of-global-chip-sales-now-surpasses-taiwan-closing-in-on-europe-and-japan/)\u00a0are rapidly trying to decouple their semiconductor ecosystems from each other; China is pouring $100+ billion of government incentives in building Chinese fabs, while simultaneously trying to create indigenous supplies of wafer fab equipment and electronic design automation software\n- Over the last few decades the U.S. moved most of its fabs to Asia. Today we are incentivizing bringing fabs and chip production back to the U.S.\nAn industry that previously was only of interest to technologists is now one of the largest pieces in great power competition.\n\n>  [Steve Blank The Semiconductor Ecosystem \u2013 Explained](https://steveblank.com/2022/01/25/the-semiconductor-ecosystem/)\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1768187612, "style": "", "script": "<script src='https://blog.meekdai.com/Gmeek/plugins/GmeekTOC.js'></script><script src='https://blog.meekdai.com/Gmeek/plugins/GmeekVercount.js'></script><script src='https://blog.meekdai.com/Gmeek/plugins/lightbox.js'></script>", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247273453?s=96&v=4", "createdDate": "2026-01-12", "dateLabelColor": "#1f883d"}, "P11": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/The Pioneering of Reliability into the 21st Century.html", "labels": ["Annotation"], "postTitle": "The Pioneering of Reliability into the 21st Century", "postUrl": "post/The%20Pioneering%20of%20Reliability%20into%20the%2021st%20Century.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/hyfaust/hyfaust.github.io/issues/11", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 10329, "description": "[\u82f1\u6587\u539f\u6587]([The Pioneering of Reliability into the 21st Century - Accendo Reliability](https://accendoreliability.com/book/the-pioneering-of-reliability-into-the-21st-century/))\n\n**Keywords: Maintence; Reliability; Re-engineering; RCA**\n\n\u6211\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u5316\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u5546\u4eba\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1769569417, "style": "", "script": "<script src='https://blog.meekdai.com/Gmeek/plugins/GmeekTOC.js'></script><script src='https://blog.meekdai.com/Gmeek/plugins/GmeekVercount.js'></script><script src='https://blog.meekdai.com/Gmeek/plugins/lightbox.js'></script>", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/247273453?s=96&v=4", "createdDate": "2026-01-28", "dateLabelColor": "#1f883d"}, "P12": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/THE PROBLEM OF TEACHING PHYSICS IN LATIN AMERICA.html", "labels": ["Annotation"], "postTitle": "THE PROBLEM OF TEACHING PHYSICS IN LATIN AMERICA", "postUrl": "post/THE%20PROBLEM%20OF%20TEACHING%20PHYSICS%20IN%20LATIN%20AMERICA.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/hyfaust/hyfaust.github.io/issues/12", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 19348, "description": "#spirit #Feynman\n## Revised from One of Feynman's speechs\n### The reasons why I believe we should teach physics\n1. The first reason is, of course, that physics is a basic science, and as such is used in engineering, chemistry, and biology, and has all kinds of applications in technology.\u00a0 Physics is the science, or knowledge of nature, that **tells us how things work**.\u00a0 In particular, I am stressing here how devices of various kinds \u2013 invented by men in present and forthcoming technology \u2013 work.\u00a0 Therefore, those who know physics will be much more useful in coping with the technical problems arising in local industry.\n2. A secondary reason for teaching physics, or any experimental science, is that it incidentally **teaches how to do things with your hands**.\u00a0 It teaches many techniques for manipulating things \u2013 as well as techniques of measurement and calculation, for example \u2013 which have very much wider applications than the particular field of study.\n   Another major reason for teaching physics is for the science itself.\u00a0 Science is an activity of men; to many men it is **a great pleasure** and it should not be denied to the people of a large part of the world simply because of a fault or lack in the educational system.\u00a0 In other words, one of the reasons for teaching science is to make scientists who will not just contribute to the development of industry but also contribute to the development of knowledge, joining others in this great adventure of our times, and, of course, obtaining enormous pleasure in doing so.\n3. Thirdly, there is good reason to **study nature to appreciate its wonder and its beauty**, even though one may not become an actively\u2011working professional scientist.\u00a0 This knowledge of nature also gives a feeling of stability and reality about the world and drives out many fears and superstitions.\n4. A fourth value in teaching science is to **teach how things are found out**.\u00a0 The value of questioning, the value of free ideas \u2013 not only for the development of science, but the value of free ideas in every field \u2013 becomes apparent.\u00a0 Science is a way to teach how something gets to be known, what is not known, to what extent things are known (for nothing is known absolutely), how to handle doubt and uncertainty, what the rules of evidence are, how to think about things so that judgments can be made, how to distinguish truth from fraud, and from show.\u00a0 These are certainly important secondary yields of teaching science, and physics in particular.\n5. Finally, in learning science you **learn to handle trial and error**, to develop a spirit of invention and of free inquiry which is of tremendous value far beyond science.\u00a0 One learns to ask oneself: 'Is there a better [way to](http://way.to/) do it?'\u00a0 (And the answer to this is not the conditioned reflex: 'Let's see how they do it in the United States,' because there must certainly be a better way than that!)\u00a0 We must try to think of some new gimmick or idea, to find some improvement in the technique.\u00a0 This question is the source of a great deal of free independent thought, of invention, and of human progress of all kinds.\n### Some of the major characteristics of science education in Latin America\n1. **First, and most serious, I believe, is the almost exclusive teaching and learning by means of pure abject memory.**\u00a0 This in no way teaches physics as a science.\u00a0 Nothing is understood; it is only remembered.\u00a0 This in no way satisfies the reasons I outlined for teaching science.\u00a0 Memorization of laws does not permit one to make applications of these laws to new situations; it does not permit one the pleasure of ultimately making scientific contributions; it cannot teach any techniques with the hands.\u00a0 From memorizing, knowledge is not understood, and the beauty of nature is not appreciated.\u00a0 It does not tell how things were found out, or reveal the value of an inventive free mind.\n   For example, the telescope is an interesting device to make, understand, look through, and play with.\u00a0 It turned men's ideas and minds in new directions.\u00a0 It gave a great impetus to the modern revolution of thought.\u00a0 For a long while it was the sole revealer of the vastness of the heavens and man's modest place in it.\u00a0 But, in Latin America one learns that there are four kinds of telescopes: the Newtonian, the Cassigranian, etc., etc.\u00a0 In the first, the image is virtual and inverted, etc. (I put in all this 'etc.' because I really don't know how many kinds of telescopes there are, or what their names are, or which way the image is in each kind.\u00a0 But don't underestimate me; I know a very great deal about telescopes \u2013 how they work, how to make and use one, their powers and limitations, etc.)\u00a0 The result is that the telescope is lost.\u00a0 There is no more telescope, no lenses, no stars, no eyes, no light \u2013 just words memorized without requiring understanding.\u00a0 The examination is passed, for the question was 'What are the four types of telescopes?'\n   I must say immediately that I am not against memorizing.\u00a0 Some things, even many (though nothing special) may be learned by heart; for example, it is good, but not essential, to know by heart 7 x 8 = 56.\u00a0 What I oppose in any teaching philosophy is that the philosophy is used exclu\u00adsively; but in this case it is especially serious because so little is left of the subject.\n   It was incomprehensible to the people of my country when I reported how material is memorized in Latin America completely without understanding.\u00a0 Lectures are dictated so slowly that students can copy them word for word into their notebooks \u2013 and sentences are even repeated so they can check them back.\n   When asked what Brewster's Law is, advanced students answer in a flash: 'Light impinging on a material of index n is 100 percent polarized with the electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence if the tangent of the angle of incidence equals the index of refraction.'\n   To these same students I then say, 'Look out at the bay from which the sunlight is being reflected.\u00a0 If I look at that reflection through this piece of polaroid and turn it, what will happen?'\u00a0 All I receive are blank stares.\u00a0 No one knows.\u00a0 But I get cries of surprise and delight when they try it and see the reflections getting brighter and dimmer.\n   This shows something is completely wrong.\u00a0 There is no knowledge whatsoever of nature.\u00a0 With the wrong entrance clue the memorization is useless.\u00a0 These students are like books, no more.\u00a0 I can look in the index of a book under 'Brewster's Law' and find a reference equivalent to the students' reply.\u00a0 But in the index I cannot find 'sun reflecting on bay.'\n   What do the students know that is not easily and directly available in a book?\u00a0 The things that can be looked up in a book are only a part of knowledge.\u00a0 Who wants such a student to work in a plant when a book requiring no food or maintenance stands day after day always ready to give just as adequate answers?\u00a0 Who wants to be such a student, to have worked so hard, to have missed so much of interest and pleasure, and to be outdone by an inanimate printed list of 'laws'?\n2. A second problem in Latin America is that **the students are all alone**.\u00a0 They cannot converse with other students; they cannot see how stupid some fellow students are.\u00a0 This is mainly for some psychological reason.\u00a0 They do not wish to be found unsure, for they will be ridiculed.\u00a0 They cannot ask questions in class because the others later say, 'Why do you waste the time of all of us?\u00a0 Everyone knows that.'\u00a0 So, to save face, they all put on a show of knowledge, thereby frustrating free discussion and the exchange of ideas \u2013 one of the pleasantest and easiest ways of learning things.\u00a0 There is too much show, and too much formality in the classroom for any exercise of free thought and discussion.\n3. A third problem is **the lack of freedom in the university structure**.\u00a0 You cannot move around from one subject to another or from one lab to another.\u00a0 Those who go abroad to learn find it difficult to communicate their new knowledge easily and directly to the university students when they return \u2013 for they cannot find a place in, and are not welcomed into, the university structure.\u00a0 For some reason or other, it becomes necessary for such people to create new and separate research institutes.\u00a0 The spirit of excitement in these institutions as their research progresses is not found in the universities, and this is quite unfortunate.\n4. Another problem in Latin America is that **there is very little outlet for the students who do not want to become complete scientists.\u00a0 It is not easy for them to obtain jobs in the developing industries here**.\u00a0 Perhaps if these students were really adequately trained, the companies would gradually realize their value and this problem would disappear.\u00a0 But some of the enthusiastic students are not geniuses, and there must be some place for them to go \u2013 even though they are not going to make any scientific contribution, or become second Einsteins.\n   When I began studying at MIT I started in mathematics, and probably I thought I would be a mathematician.\u00a0 Then I discovered that the only use of higher mathematics is to teach more higher mathematics and I turned to something more practical \u2013 electrical engineering.\u00a0 Finally I realized I had gone too far in the other direction and chose something in between \u2013 physics.\n   This was all very easy because, for such closely related subjects, the courses taken by students in each discipline were almost exactly the same and were taught by the same professors.\u00a0 The engineers studied physics taught by the physicists, for instance, and the physicists learned some of their electricity in a course taught by the professors of electrical engineering.\u00a0 It is easy for students to move back and forth among related disciplines.\u00a0 If physics is too difficult for them, or mathematics too abstract, they can turn to engineering and can later expect to find a position somewhere.\u00a0 Such changes are much more difficult in Latin American universities.\n5. Another characteristic of the situation in Latin America is **the small number of people involved**: the result is a rapid fluctuation and irregularity in the character of organizations and institutions.\u00a0 How something goes depends very much on particular individuals.\n6. Finally, we must mention the problem of **the best students leaving to go to other countries**.\u00a0 This is because of the **lack of opportunities** in Latin America, the climate of rigidity that exists in the universities, and the vagaries of fortune of the research institutions as their budgets find uneven support from year to year, from the government and private sources of funds.\n### The questions for which I think we must seek answers\n1. First, **how can we free the lower levels of secondary education from the drudge memorization** that exists at the present time?\u00a0 It is well known that you can get children quite interested in science in a true, live, and active way while they are young.\u00a0 It is sometimes said you cannot get them interested by the time they are in the university, but this is not true \u2013 provided they have not been destroyed as thinking humans at the earlier levels.\n   Gibbon said: 'The power of instruction is of little efficacy, except in those happy dispositions where it is nearly superfluous.'\u00a0 This is not really true.\u00a0 It is true of good instruction, but bad instruction can be very efficacious indeed in impressing on one how impossibly dull some subject is.\u00a0 It is possible to destroy the excitement and interest that students may have gained by discovering a small book in the library, by buying a toy, a chemistry set, or a little electric motor \u2013 by playing around.\u00a0 In fact, one of the most important sources of motivation of interest in science is in a toy, or in a special book, and from those few teachers who are free enough from the bonds of an educational system to be able to keep children excited and inspired by supplying them with suggestions, demonstrations, and games.\n   It is a well known experience in education that, in spite of all plans and programs, ultimately almost everything depends on teachers \u2013 on individual teachers.\u00a0 You can have poor teachers and, no matter what you try to do with them, the students learn very little.\u00a0 Or you can have good teachers and it doesn't make much difference what you do,  provided you leave the teacher free.\u00a0 So I think we must find how to free those few teachers who can be inspiring to children.\u00a0 It is important that those inspiring teachers work along with children, suggesting experiments and trying them freely.\n2. The second question we shall have to try to answer is **how to bring engineers and other applied scientists closer to their real world of application**.\u00a0 It is not enough for them to remember exactly how to use the formula, providing that the situation is exactly the same as the situation was in the engineering school when the professor dictated the lecture.\u00a0 We must do something to make the applied engineer more flexible, so that he is effective in a wide range of applications.\n   One way may be to have true scientists \u2013 and especially active research experimental physicists \u2013 teaching physics to some engineering students.\u00a0 Experimental physics generates technical problems.\u00a0 To succeed, you have to work with your hands; you have to meet reality; pure memory won't do.\u00a0 So, people who are good at experimental physics know what engineering problems are.\n   The development of industrial technology is in a great measure simply the wider application of techniques which in most cases were developed by scientists trying to do experiments.\u00a0 This is because, in trying to do some experiment in science, you have to push some technique to the extreme.\u00a0 In doing so, you learn how things can be done.\u00a0 Experimental physicists first pursued the problems of how to make a higher vacuum or a lower temperature than ever before, and now high vacuum and low temperatures are tools of industrial technology.\n   Therefore, experimental science is a source of engineering and experimental science should be taught to engineers in school to keep them aware of the wide range of techniques available and the open possibilities of the future.\u00a0 Perhaps, then, after we have created enough real engineers with real value to industry in Latin America, industry will see that there is no advantage to hiring engineers from overseas and will want more of the locally-trained men and will support the schools with methods of teaching which produce such engineers.\u00a0 Then we will have the ball rolling.\n   I understand that the number of engineering schools in Latin America is growing rapidly.\u00a0 For example, in Brazil there are twice as many engineering schools as there were ten years ago.\u00a0 If this is the case, then maybe the problem can solve itself.\u00a0 If these schools are not all organized under the same system, if there is a variety in the schools, then one or another school may develop a way to produce excellent students \u2013 if the secondary school preparation has not first ruined them.\u00a0 Then this school will acquire a reputation, children will try to go there, other schools will try to compete and copy the better methods\u2011and so on until the problem solves itself.\n3. The third problem that we have here is **how to encourage the true research workers and keep them from leaving home permanently**.\u00a0 We have to supply them with books, with experimental equipment, with money for visits abroad, and with a coterie of active interested students.\u00a0 No, excuse me \u2013 the coterie will form automatically if the researcher is good and can get to students in any way at all.\n   It is imperative to encourage the true research worker who is making contributions to science to make his home base in his own country.\u00a0 This should not be hard because there are strong feelings of patriotism in these men; they know they have a great deal to give their country and want to give it.\u00a0 The difficulty is the terrible problems they have at home.\u00a0 For example, the physics research center in Rio, which is one of the leading ones in Latin America, has become isolated from the rest of the world because of a very simple thing: Nobody wants to pay for the _Physical Review_ or _Nuovo Cimento_. Nobody wants to pay for the journals that can keep people informed of what happens somewhere else.\n   \u00a0This, along with the fact that salaries are absurdly low, shows a lack of interest by the Brazilian government, people, and industry, in the development of science in this country.\u00a0 It is an attitude that does not respect or understand the value of these men.\u00a0 These creating scientists should have a dignity and a power to control their own destiny, and that of science and of science education in their countries.\u00a0 It will be in safe, loving hands.\n   \u00a0It is from the fountain of research workers who understand what science is really about that the true spirit of inquiry rains onto their students, and their students' students, and ultimately, if things are organized right, permeates the entire educational system and speeds the technical development of the country.\n4. The fourth problem, then, is **how to get these research workers back into the universities where they belong**.\u00a0 Then the 'rain' will have a far easier and direct passage to the students, the new scientists of the country.\n5. I should like to emphasize, by addressing my fifth and final question to the problem, **the importance of doing any of these things in a steady, consistent, continuous, and modest way.\u00a0 It should not be done with a big show, the big money, with much advertising, unsupported in the future by any effective maintenance.**\u00a0 Maintenance is lacking in many of these projects, for these things have happened before.\u00a0 Pulses of energy have been liberated, forward steps have been taken, only to slip back for lack of continued support.\u00a0 It is necessary to keep up anything that works out.\u00a0 It is necessary to provide a continuous, consistent, perpetual support and to make things more modest so that continuity of support can be maintained.\u00a0 A research group becomes world famous only after years of fruitful research.\u00a0 One year of no support and people drift away and there is nothing left.\n   I appreciate that this is a problem of great difficulty and seriousness because it involves so closely all of the social and economic circumstances in the country, and the difficulties are often (but not always) merely the reflection of the vastly more serious problems of the varying fortune of the country as a whole.\u00a0 Yet we ought to discuss it further here.\u00a0 We might try to see if there are ways to work out a scheme so that the educational system, or at least such critical parts of it as research scientists or especially good teachers, is partially independent of the variations in success of the government.\n   Perhaps it should not be completely supported by government.\u00a0 Perhaps greater efforts to obtain private funds might work.\u00a0 Possibly more reliance on, and contact with, more permanent institutions like religious schools might sustain the continuity of these efforts.\n\n> [THE PROBLEM OF TEACHING PHYSICS IN LATIN AMERICA](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/46/2/LatinAmerica.htm)\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1769570063,
