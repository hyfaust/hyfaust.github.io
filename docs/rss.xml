## Revised from One of Feynman's speechs
### The reasons why I believe we should teach physics
1. The first reason is, of course, that physics is a basic science, and as such is used in engineering, chemistry, and biology, and has all kinds of applications in technology.  Physics is the science, or knowledge of nature, that **tells us how things work**.  In particular, I am stressing here how devices of various kinds – invented by men in present and forthcoming technology – work.  Therefore, those who know physics will be much more useful in coping with the technical problems arising in local industry.
2. A secondary reason for teaching physics, or any experimental science, is that it incidentally **teaches how to do things with your hands**.  It teaches many techniques for manipulating things – as well as techniques of measurement and calculation, for example – which have very much wider applications than the particular field of study.
   Another major reason for teaching physics is for the science itself.  Science is an activity of men; to many men it is **a great pleasure** and it should not be denied to the people of a large part of the world simply because of a fault or lack in the educational system.  In other words, one of the reasons for teaching science is to make scientists who will not just contribute to the development of industry but also contribute to the development of knowledge, joining others in this great adventure of our times, and, of course, obtaining enormous pleasure in doing so.
3. Thirdly, there is good reason to **study nature to appreciate its wonder and its beauty**, even though one may not become an actively‑working professional scientist.  This knowledge of nature also gives a feeling of stability and reality about the world and drives out many fears and superstitions.
4. A fourth value in teaching science is to **teach how things are found out**.  The value of questioning, the value of free ideas – not only for the development of science, but the value of free ideas in every field – becomes apparent.  Science is a way to teach how something gets to be known, what is not known, to what extent things are known (for nothing is known absolutely), how to handle doubt and uncertainty, what the rules of evidence are, how to think about things so that judgments can be made, how to distinguish truth from fraud, and from show.  These are certainly important secondary yields of teaching science, and physics in particular.
5. Finally, in learning science you **learn to handle trial and error**, to develop a spirit of invention and of free inquiry which is of tremendous value far beyond science.  One learns to ask oneself: 'Is there a better [way to](http://way.to/) do it?'  (And the answer to this is not the conditioned reflex: 'Let's see how they do it in the United States,' because there must certainly be a better way than that!)  We must try to think of some new gimmick or idea, to find some improvement in the technique.  This question is the source of a great deal of free independent thought, of invention, and of human progress of all kinds.
### Some of the major characteristics of science education in Latin America
1. **First, and most serious, I believe, is the almost exclusive teaching and learning by means of pure abject memory.**  This in no way teaches physics as a science.  Nothing is understood; it is only remembered.  This in no way satisfies the reasons I outlined for teaching science.  Memorization of laws does not permit one to make applications of these laws to new situations; it does not permit one the pleasure of ultimately making scientific contributions; it cannot teach any techniques with the hands.  From memorizing, knowledge is not understood, and the beauty of nature is not appreciated.  It does not tell how things were found out, or reveal the value of an inventive free mind.
   For example, the telescope is an interesting device to make, understand, look through, and play with.  It turned men's ideas and minds in new directions.  It gave a great impetus to the modern revolution of thought.  For a long while it was the sole revealer of the vastness of the heavens and man's modest place in it.  But, in Latin America one learns that there are four kinds of telescopes: the Newtonian, the Cassigranian, etc., etc.  In the first, the image is virtual and inverted, etc. (I put in all this 'etc.' because I really don't know how many kinds of telescopes there are, or what their names are, or which way the image is in each kind.  But don't underestimate me; I know a very great deal about telescopes – how they work, how to make and use one, their powers and limitations, etc.)  The result is that the telescope is lost.  There is no more telescope, no lenses, no stars, no eyes, no light – just words memorized without requiring understanding.  The examination is passed, for the question was 'What are the four types of telescopes?'
   I must say immediately that I am not against memorizing.  Some things, even many (though nothing special) may be learned by heart; for example, it is good, but not essential, to know by heart 7 x 8 = 56.  What I oppose in any teaching philosophy is that the philosophy is used exclu­sively; but in this case it is especially serious because so little is left of the subject.
   It was incomprehensible to the people of my country when I reported how material is memorized in Latin America completely without understanding.  Lectures are dictated so slowly that students can copy them word for word into their notebooks – and sentences are even repeated so they can check them back.
   When asked what Brewster's Law is, advanced students answer in a flash: 'Light impinging on a material of index n is 100 percent polarized with the electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence if the tangent of the angle of incidence equals the index of refraction.'
   To these same students I then say, 'Look out at the bay from which the sunlight is being reflected.  If I look at that reflection through this piece of polaroid and turn it, what will happen?'  All I receive are blank stares.  No one knows.  But I get cries of surprise and delight when they try it and see the reflections getting brighter and dimmer.
   This shows something is completely wrong.  There is no knowledge whatsoever of nature.  With the wrong entrance clue the memorization is useless.  These students are like books, no more.  I can look in the index of a book under 'Brewster's Law' and find a reference equivalent to the students' reply.  But in the index I cannot find 'sun reflecting on bay.'
   What do the students know that is not easily and directly available in a book?  The things that can be looked up in a book are only a part of knowledge.  Who wants such a student to work in a plant when a book requiring no food or maintenance stands day after day always ready to give just as adequate answers?  Who wants to be such a student, to have worked so hard, to have missed so much of interest and pleasure, and to be outdone by an inanimate printed list of 'laws'?
2. A second problem in Latin America is that **the students are all alone**.  They cannot converse with other students; they cannot see how stupid some fellow students are.  This is mainly for some psychological reason.  They do not wish to be found unsure, for they will be ridiculed.  They cannot ask questions in class because the others later say, 'Why do you waste the time of all of us?  Everyone knows that.'  So, to save face, they all put on a show of knowledge, thereby frustrating free discussion and the exchange of ideas – one of the pleasantest and easiest ways of learning things.  There is too much show, and too much formality in the classroom for any exercise of free thought and discussion.
3. A third problem is **the lack of freedom in the university structure**.  You cannot move around from one subject to another or from one lab to another.  Those who go abroad to learn find it difficult to communicate their new knowledge easily and directly to the university students when they return – for they cannot find a place in, and are not welcomed into, the university structure.  For some reason or other, it becomes necessary for such people to create new and separate research institutes.  The spirit of excitement in these institutions as their research progresses is not found in the universities, and this is quite unfortunate.
4. Another problem in Latin America is that **there is very little outlet for the students who do not want to become complete scientists.  It is not easy for them to obtain jobs in the developing industries here**.  Perhaps if these students were really adequately trained, the companies would gradually realize their value and this problem would disappear.  But some of the enthusiastic students are not geniuses, and there must be some place for them to go – even though they are not going to make any scientific contribution, or become second Einsteins.
   When I began studying at MIT I started in mathematics, and probably I thought I would be a mathematician.  Then I discovered that the only use of higher mathematics is to teach more higher mathematics and I turned to something more practical – electrical engineering.  Finally I realized I had gone too far in the other direction and chose something in between – physics.
   This was all very easy because, for such closely related subjects, the courses taken by students in each discipline were almost exactly the same and were taught by the same professors.  The engineers studied physics taught by the physicists, for instance, and the physicists learned some of their electricity in a course taught by the professors of electrical engineering.  It is easy for students to move back and forth among related disciplines.  If physics is too difficult for them, or mathematics too abstract, they can turn to engineering and can later expect to find a position somewhere.  Such changes are much more difficult in Latin American universities.
5. Another characteristic of the situation in Latin America is **the small number of people involved**: the result is a rapid fluctuation and irregularity in the character of organizations and institutions.  How something goes depends very much on particular individuals.
6. Finally, we must mention the problem of **the best students leaving to go to other countries**.  This is because of the **lack of opportunities** in Latin America, the climate of rigidity that exists in the universities, and the vagaries of fortune of the research institutions as their budgets find uneven support from year to year, from the government and private sources of funds.
### The questions for which I think we must seek answers
1. First, **how can we free the lower levels of secondary education from the drudge memorization** that exists at the present time?  It is well known that you can get children quite interested in science in a true, live, and active way while they are young.  It is sometimes said you cannot get them interested by the time they are in the university, but this is not true – provided they have not been destroyed as thinking humans at the earlier levels.
   Gibbon said: 'The power of instruction is of little efficacy, except in those happy dispositions where it is nearly superfluous.'  This is not really true.  It is true of good instruction, but bad instruction can be very efficacious indeed in impressing on one how impossibly dull some subject is.  It is possible to destroy the excitement and interest that students may have gained by discovering a small book in the library, by buying a toy, a chemistry set, or a little electric motor – by playing around.  In fact, one of the most important sources of motivation of interest in science is in a toy, or in a special book, and from those few teachers who are free enough from the bonds of an educational system to be able to keep children excited and inspired by supplying them with suggestions, demonstrations, and games.
   It is a well known experience in education that, in spite of all plans and programs, ultimately almost everything depends on teachers – on individual teachers.  You can have poor teachers and, no matter what you try to do with them, the students learn very little.  Or you can have good teachers and it doesn't make much difference what you do,  provided you leave the teacher free.  So I think we must find how to free those few teachers who can be inspiring to children.  It is important that those inspiring teachers work along with children, suggesting experiments and trying them freely.
2. The second question we shall have to try to answer is **how to bring engineers and other applied scientists closer to their real world of application**.  It is not enough for them to remember exactly how to use the formula, providing that the situation is exactly the same as the situation was in the engineering school when the professor dictated the lecture.  We must do something to make the applied engineer more flexible, so that he is effective in a wide range of applications.
   One way may be to have true scientists – and especially active research experimental physicists – teaching physics to some engineering students.  Experimental physics generates technical problems.  To succeed, you have to work with your hands; you have to meet reality; pure memory won't do.  So, people who are good at experimental physics know what engineering problems are.
   The development of industrial technology is in a great measure simply the wider application of techniques which in most cases were developed by scientists trying to do experiments.  This is because, in trying to do some experiment in science, you have to push some technique to the extreme.  In doing so, you learn how things can be done.  Experimental physicists first pursued the problems of how to make a higher vacuum or a lower temperature than ever before, and now high vacuum and low temperatures are tools of industrial technology.
   Therefore, experimental science is a source of engineering and experimental science should be taught to engineers in school to keep them aware of the wide range of techniques available and the open possibilities of the future.  Perhaps, then, after we have created enough real engineers with real value to industry in Latin America, industry will see that there is no advantage to hiring engineers from overseas and will want more of the locally-trained men and will support the schools with methods of teaching which produce such engineers.  Then we will have the ball rolling.
   I understand that the number of engineering schools in Latin America is growing rapidly.  For example, in Brazil there are twice as many engineering schools as there were ten years ago.  If this is the case, then maybe the problem can solve itself.  If these schools are not all organized under the same system, if there is a variety in the schools, then one or another school may develop a way to produce excellent students – if the secondary school preparation has not first ruined them.  Then this school will acquire a reputation, children will try to go there, other schools will try to compete and copy the better methods‑and so on until the problem solves itself.
3. The third problem that we have here is **how to encourage the true research workers and keep them from leaving home permanently**.  We have to supply them with books, with experimental equipment, with money for visits abroad, and with a coterie of active interested students.  No, excuse me – the coterie will form automatically if the researcher is good and can get to students in any way at all.
   It is imperative to encourage the true research worker who is making contributions to science to make his home base in his own country.  This should not be hard because there are strong feelings of patriotism in these men; they know they have a great deal to give their country and want to give it.  The difficulty is the terrible problems they have at home.  For example, the physics research center in Rio, which is one of the leading ones in Latin America, has become isolated from the rest of the world because of a very simple thing: Nobody wants to pay for the _Physical Review_ or _Nuovo Cimento_. Nobody wants to pay for the journals that can keep people informed of what happens somewhere else.
    This, along with the fact that salaries are absurdly low, shows a lack of interest by the Brazilian government, people, and industry, in the development of science in this country.  It is an attitude that does not respect or understand the value of these men.  These creating scientists should have a dignity and a power to control their own destiny, and that of science and of science education in their countries.  It will be in safe, loving hands.
    It is from the fountain of research workers who understand what science is really about that the true spirit of inquiry rains onto their students, and their students' students, and ultimately, if things are organized right, permeates the entire educational system and speeds the technical development of the country.
4. The fourth problem, then, is **how to get these research workers back into the universities where they belong**.  Then the 'rain' will have a far easier and direct passage to the students, the new scientists of the country.
5. I should like to emphasize, by addressing my fifth and final question to the problem, **the importance of doing any of these things in a steady, consistent, continuous, and modest way.  It should not be done with a big show, the big money, with much advertising, unsupported in the future by any effective maintenance.**  Maintenance is lacking in many of these projects, for these things have happened before.  Pulses of energy have been liberated, forward steps have been taken, only to slip back for lack of continued support.  It is necessary to keep up anything that works out.  It is necessary to provide a continuous, consistent, perpetual support and to make things more modest so that continuity of support can be maintained.  A research group becomes world famous only after years of fruitful research.  One year of no support and people drift away and there is nothing left.
   I appreciate that this is a problem of great difficulty and seriousness because it involves so closely all of the social and economic circumstances in the country, and the difficulties are often (but not always) merely the reflection of the vastly more serious problems of the varying fortune of the country as a whole.  Yet we ought to discuss it further here.  We might try to see if there are ways to work out a scheme so that the educational system, or at least such critical parts of it as research scientists or especially good teachers, is partially independent of the variations in success of the government.
   Perhaps it should not be completely supported by government.  Perhaps greater efforts to obtain private funds might work.  Possibly more reliance on, and contact with, more permanent institutions like religious schools might sustain the continuity of these efforts.

## **The Semiconductor Ecosystem**
Looking at the figure below, the industry seems pretty simple. Companies in the semiconductor ecosystem make chips (the triangle on the left) and sell them to companies and government agencies (on the right). Those companies and government agencies then design the chips into systems and devices (e.g. iPhones, PCs, airplanes, cloud computing, etc.), and sell them to consumers, businesses, and governments. The revenue of products that contain chips is worth tens of trillions of dollars.
![[The Semiconductor Ecosystem.png]]
Yet, given how large it is, the industry remains a mystery to most.  If you do think of the semiconductor industry at all, you may picture workers in bunny suits in a fab clean room (the chip factory) holding a 12” wafer. Yet it is a business that manipulates materials an atom at a time and its factories cost 10s of billions of dollars to build.  (By the way, that wafer has two _trillion_ transistors on it.)
![[clean-room-holding-a-wafer.png]]
If you were able to look inside the simple triangle representing the semiconductor industry, instead of a single company making chips, you would find an industry with hundreds of companies, all dependent on each other. Taken as a whole it’s pretty overwhelming, so let’s describe one part of the ecosystem at a time.  (Warning –  this is a _simplified_ view of a very complex industry.)
## **Semiconductor Industry Segments**
The semiconductor industry has seven different types of companies. Each of these distinct industry segments feeds its resources up the value chain to the next until finally a chip factory (a “Fab”) has all the designs, equipment, and materials necessary to manufacture a chip. Taken from the bottom up these semiconductor industry segments are:
1. Chip Intellectual Property (IP) 
2. Electronic Design Automation (EDA)
3. Specialized Materials 
4. Wafer Fab Equipment (WFE)
5. “Fabless” Chip Companies 
6. Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs)
7. Chip Foundries
8. Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT)
![[semi-eco-plus-OSAT.png]]
The following sections below provide more detail about each of these eight semiconductor industry segments.
### **Chip Intellectual Property (IP) Cores**
- The _design_ of a chip may be owned by a single company, or…
- Some companies license their chip designs – as software building blocks, called IP Cores – for wide use
- There are over 150 companies that sell chip IP Cores
- For example, Apple licenses IP Cores from [ARM](https://www.arm.com/) as a building block of their microprocessors in their iPhones and Computers
![[Chip-IP-cores.png]]
### **Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Tools**
- Engineers design chips (adding their own designs on top of any IP cores they’ve bought) using specialized Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software
- The industry is dominated by three U.S. vendors–[Cadence](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home.html), [Mentor](https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/) (now part of Siemens) and [Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/)
- It takes a large engineering team using these EDA tools 2-3 years to design a complex logic chip like a microprocessor used inside a phone, computer or server. (See the figure of the design process below.)
  ![[EDA-Design-flow.png]]
-  Today, as logic chips continue to become more complex, all Electronic Design Automation companies are beginning to insert Artificial Intelligence aids to automate and speed up the process
![[EDA-tools.png]]
### **Specialized Materials and Chemicals**
So far our chip is still in software. But to turn it into something tangible we’re going to have to physically produce it in a chip factory called a “fab.” The factories that make chips need to buy specialized materials and chemicals:

- Silicon wafers – and to make those they need crystal growing furnaces
- [Over 100 Gases](https://www.linde-gas.com/en/images/Gasworld%20-%20Creating%20a%20Semiconductor%20FEB18_tcm17-477345.pdf) are used – bulk gases (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, argon, helium), and other exotic/toxic gases (fluorine, nitrogen trifluoride, arsine, phosphine, boron trifluoride, diborane, silane, and the list goes on…)
- Fluids ([photoresists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresist), top coats, [CMP slurries](https://www.surfaceconditioning.saint-gobain.com/news/choosing-best-cmp-slurry))
- [Photomasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomask)
- Wafer handling equipment, dicing
- [RF Generators](https://www.microwavejournal.com/articles/21140-rf-technology-in-semiconductor-wafer-processing)
![[materials-small.png]]
### **Wafer Fab Equipment (WFE) Make the Chips**
- These machines physically manufacture the chips
- Five companies dominate the industry– [Applied Materials](https://www.appliedmaterials.com/), [KLA](https://www.kla.com/), [LAM](https://www.lamresearch.com/), [Tokyo Electron](https://www.tel.com/) and [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en)
- These are some of the most complicated (and expensive) machines on Earth. They take a slice of an ingot of silicon and manipulate its atoms on and below its surface
- We’ll explain how these machines are used a bit later on
![[Wafer-Fab-Equipment.png]]
###  **“Fabless” Chip Companies**
- Systems companies (Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) that previously used off-the-shelf chips now design their own chips.
- They create chip designs (using IP Cores and their own designs) and send the designs to “foundries” that have “fabs” that manufacture them
- They may use the chips exclusively in their own devices e.g. Apple, Google, Amazon ….
- Or they may sell the chips to everyone e.g. AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom…
- They do not own Wafer Fab Equipment or use specialized materials or chemicals
- They do use Chip IP and Electronic Design Software to design the chips
![[fabless.png]]
### **Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs)**
- Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) design, manufacture (in their own fabs), and sell _their own_ chips
    - They do not make chips for other companies (this is changing rapidly – see [here](https://stratechery.com/2022/the-intel-split/).)
    - There are three categories of IDMs– Memory (e.g. [Micron](https://www.micron.com/), [SK Hynix](https://product.skhynix.com/home.go)), Logic (e.g. [Intel](http://www.intel.com/)), Analog ([TI](https://www.ti.com/), [Analog Devices](https://www.analog.com/en/index.html))
- They have their own “fabs” but may also use foundries
    - They use Chip IP and Electronic Design Software to design their chips
    - They buy Wafer Fab Equipment and use specialized materials and chemicals
- The average cost of taping out a new leading-edge chip (3nm) is now $500 million
![[IDMs.png]]
###  **Chip Foundries**
- Foundries make chips for others in their “fabs”
- They buy and integrate equipment from a variety of manufacturers
    - Wafer Fab Equipment and specialized materials and chemicals
- They design unique processes using this equipment to _make_ the chips
- But they _don’t design chips_
- [TSMC](https://www.tsmc.com/english) in Taiwan is the leader in logic, [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/) is second
- Other fabs specialize in making chips for analog, power, rf, displays, secure military, etc.
- It costs $20 billon to build a new generation chip (3nm) fabrication plant
![[foundries.png]]
#### **Fabs**
- Fabs are short for fabrication plants – the factory that makes chips
- Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) _and_ Foundries both have fabs. The only difference is whether they make chips for others to use or sell or make them for themselves to sell.
- Think of a Fab as analogous to a book printing plant (see figure below)
1. Just as an author writes a book using a word processor, an engineer designs a chip using electronic design automation tools
2. An author contracts with a publisher who specializes in their genre and then sends the text to a printing plant. An engineer selects a fab appropriate for their type of chip (memory, logic, RF, analog)
3. The printing plant buys paper and ink. A fab buys raw materials; silicon, chemicals, gases
4. The printing plant buys printing machinery, presses, binders, trimmers. The fab buys wafer fab equipment, etchers, deposition, lithography, testers, packaging
5. The printing process for a book uses offset lithography, filming, stripping, blueprints, plate making, binding and trimming. Chips are manufactured in a complicated process manipulating atoms using etchers, deposition, lithography. Think of it as an atomic level offset printing. The wafers are then cut up and the chips are packaged
6. The plant turns out millions of copies of the same book. The plant turns out millions of copies of the same chip
![[printing.png]]
While this sounds simple, it’s not. Chips are probably the most complicated products ever manufactured.  The diagram below is a simplified version of the _1000+_ steps it takes to make a chip.
![[Chip-fab-steps.png]]
### Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT)
- Companies that package and test chips made by foundries and IDMs
- OSAT companies take the wafer made by foundries, dice (cut) them up into individual chips, test them and then package them and ship them to the customer
![[OSAT.png]]
## **Fab Issues**
- As chips have become denser (with trillions of transistors on a single wafer) the cost of building fabs have skyrocketed – now &gt;$10 billion for one chip factory
- One reason is that the cost of the equipment needed to make the chips has skyrocketed
    - Just one advanced lithography machine from [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en), a Dutch company, costs $150 million
    - There are ~500+ machines in a fab (not all as expensive as ASML)
    - The fab building is incredibly complex. The clean room where the chips are made is just the tip of the iceberg of a complex set of plumbing feeding gases, power, liquids all at the right time and temperature into the wafer fab equipment
- The multi-billion-dollar cost of staying at the leading edge has meant most companies have dropped out. In 2001 there were 17 companies making the most advanced chips.  Today there are only two – [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/) in Korea and [TSMC](https://www.tsmc.com/english) in Taiwan.
    - Given that China believes Taiwan is a province of China this could be problematic for the West.
![[companies-at-leading-edge.png]]
## **What’s Next – Technology**
It’s getting much harder to build chips that are denser, faster, and use less power, so what’s next?
- Instead of making a single processor do all the work, logic chip designers have put multiple specialized processors inside of a chip
- Memory chips are now made denser by stacking them 100+ layers high
- As chips are getting more complex to design, which means larger design teams, and longer time to market, Electronic Design Automation companies are embedding artificial intelligence to automate parts of the design process
- Wafer equipment manufacturers are designing new equipment to help fabs make chips with lower power, better [performance, optimum area-to-cost, and faster time to market](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10iOkW6LfURNLND8z61eXbDx_Y-8jkBRr/view?usp=sharing)
## **What’s Next – Business**
The business model of Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) like [Intel](http://www.intel.com/) is rapidly changing. In the past there was a huge competitive advantage in being vertically integrated i.e. having your own design tools and fabs. Today, it’s a disadvantage.

- Foundries have economies of scale and standardization. Rather than having to invent it all themselves, they can utilize the entire stack of innovation in the ecosystem. And just focus on manufacturing
- [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) has proven that it’s possible to shift from an IDM to a fabless foundry model. [Intel](http://www.intel.com/) is trying. They are going to use [TSMC](https://www.tsmc.com/english) as a foundry for their own chips as well as set up their own foundry
## **What’s Next – Geopolitics**
Controlling advanced chip manufacturing in the 21st century may well prove to be like controlling the oil supply in the 20th. The country that controls this manufacturing can throttle the military and economic power of others.
- Ensuring a steady supply of chips has become a national priority. (China’s largest import by $’s are semiconductors – larger than oil)
- Today, both the U.S. and [China](https://www.semiconductors.org/chinas-share-of-global-chip-sales-now-surpasses-taiwan-closing-in-on-europe-and-japan/) are rapidly trying to decouple their semiconductor ecosystems from each other; China is pouring $100+ billion of government incentives in building Chinese fabs, while simultaneously trying to create indigenous supplies of wafer fab equipment and electronic design automation software
- Over the last few decades the U.S. moved most of its fabs to Asia. Today we are incentivizing bringing fabs and chip production back to the U.S.
An industry that previously was only of interest to technologists is now one of the largest pieces in great power competition.

## BGA-1
采用六边形棱柱作初始几何构型，固定约束上下两面及边线，恒定体积设置为圆柱的1.3倍
## BGA-2
为上下两个固定面添加no_refine属性以加快计算
仅考虑表面张力的情况下，恒定体积的最终形状与张力的数值无关
## BGA-3
同时考虑表面张力和重力作用，故上下面应设置tension 0
&gt; [! Uncertain]
&gt; 仅考虑表面张力时，顶面和底面可以不设置；当同时考虑重力时，必须将其设置为0
&gt; 严格意义上应仅在壁面，气液相界面处接触设置非零的表面张力

 采用cgs单位系统
## **BGA-4**

## CPU版本torch（eg.动手深度学习）
```python
pip install torch==1.12.0  
pip install torchvision==0.13.0
pip install d2l==0.17.6
```

## PyTorch gpu版本安装及Notebook使用虚拟环境的方法
### 安装CUDA并检查
```python
nvidia-smi #查询信息，得知最高CUDA版本（实装12.8）
nvcc -V  #安装完成后检查信息
#可将DNN模块解压至C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.8\bin加速运算
```
### 虚拟环境配置及相关软件安装
```python
conda create --name gputorch python==3.11 -y #创建环境
pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio -f https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pytorch-wheels/cu128/
conda install jupyter notebook #安装notebook或者jupyterlab，conda或pip安装均可
#conda install jupyterlab
#安装完成后进入python检查torch和CUDA
python
import torch
print(torch.__version__)
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
print(torch.backends.cudnn.version())
```
### Base环境的Notebook使用其它虚拟环境的方法
```bash
conda install ipykernel #在对应环境下安装ipykernel,已安装notebook则无需再安装
conda deacitvate #退出至base环境
conda install nb_conda_kernels #内核配置管理
jupyter notebook #kernels很多的时候还是用VScode里的插件吧
```
### conda换源
```bash
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/main/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/free/
conda config --set show_channel_urls yes
```
## Jupyter notebook 和 lab 快捷方式属性
```powershell
E:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\python.exe E:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\cwp.py  E:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\envs\vml E:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\envs\vml\python.exe E:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\envs\vml\Scripts\jupyter-lab-script.py 'F:\Documents\Visualize-ML'
#conda的cwp，环境中的python，jupyterlab的启动py文件，工作目录

E:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\python.exe E:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\cwp.py E:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\envs\d2l E:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\envs\d2l\python.exe E:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\envs\d2l\Scripts\jupyter-notebook-script.py 'F:\Documents\d2l-zh-2.0.0'
